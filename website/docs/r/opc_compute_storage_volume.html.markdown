# opc\_compute\_storage\_volume

The ``opc_compute_storage_volume`` resource creates and manages a storage volume in an OPC identity domain.

~> **Caution:** The ``opc_compute_storage_volume`` resource can completely delete your storage volume just as easily as it can create it. To avoid costly accidents, consider setting [``prevent_destroy``](/docs/configuration/resources.html#prevent_destroy) on your storage volume resources as an extra safety measure.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "opc_compute_storage_volume" "test" {
  name        = "storageVolume1"
  description = "Description for the Storage Volume"
  size        = 10
  tags        = ["bar", "foo"]
}
```

##Â Example Usage (Bootable Volume)
```hcl
resource "opc_compute_image_list" "test" {
  name        = "imageList1"
  description = "Description for the Image List"
}

resource "opc_compute_image_list_entry" "test" {
  name           = "${opc_compute_image_list.test.name}"
  machine_images = [ "/oracle/public/oel_6.7_apaas_16.4.5_1610211300" ]
  version        = 1
}

resource "opc_compute_storage_volume" "test" {
  name             = "storageVolume1"
  description      = "Description for the Bootable Storage Volume"
  size             = 30
  tags             = ["first", "second"]
  bootable         = true
  image_list       = "${opc_compute_image_list.test.name}"
  image_list_entry = "${opc_compute_image_list_entry.test.version}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` (Required) The name for the Storage Account.
* `description` (Optional) The description of the storage volume.
* `size` (Required) The size of this storage volume in GB. The allowed range is from 1 GB to 2 TB (2048 GB).
* `storage_type` - (Optional) - The Type of Storage to provision. Possible values are `/oracle/public/storage/latency` or `/oracle/public/storage/default`. Defaults to `/oracle/public/storage/default`.
* `bootable` - (Optional) Is the Volume Bootable? Defaults to `false`.
* `image_list` - (Optional) Defines an image list.
* `image_list_entry` - (Optional) Defines an image list entry.
* `snapshot` - (Optional) The name of the parent snapshot from which the storage volume is restored or cloned. See [Snapshots](#snapshots), below for more information.
* `snapshot_id` - (Optional) The Id of the parent snapshot from which the storage volume is restored or cloned. See [Snapshots](#snapshots), below for more information.
* `snapshot_account` - (Optional) The Account of the parent snapshot from which the storage volume is restored. See [Snapshots](#snapshots), below for more information.
* `tags` - (Optional) Comma-separated strings that tag the storage volume.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `hypervisor` - The hypervisor that this volume is compatible with.
* `machine_image` - Name of the Machine Image - available if the volume is a bootable storage volume.
* `managed` - Is this a Managed Volume?
* `platform` - The OS platform this volume is compatible with.
* `readonly` - Can this Volume be attached as readonly?
* `status` - The current state of the storage volume.
* `storage_pool` - The storage pool from which this volume is allocated.
* `uri` - Unique Resource Identifier of the Storage Volume.

## Import

Storage Volume's can be imported using the `resource name`, e.g.

```shell
$ terraform import opc_compute_storage_volume.volume1 example
```

## Snapshots

Restoring a storage volume from a snapshot can happen via the use of the `snapshot`, `snapshot_id`, and `snapshot_account` arguments.

Note: There isn't a mechanism to restore a snapshot from a different domain, the `snapshot_account` argument needs to reference the same domain.

There are two different ways to identify the snapshot in which to restore the storage volume:

1. Use the unique `snapshot_id` argument.
1. Use a combination of `snapshot_account` and `snapshot` arguments. `snapshot_account` is in the format of:
`/Compute-mydomain/cloud_storage`, and `snapshot` is a concatenated name of the original storage volume name,
and it's child snapshot name: `mystorage/mysnapshot`.

Example 1:
```hcl
resource "opc_compute_storage_volume" "foo" {
  name = "from-snapshot"
  size = "10"
  snapshot_account = "/Compute-${var.domain}/cloud_storage"
  snapshot = "my-boot-volume/my-snapshot"
}
```

Example 2:
```hcl
data "opc_compute_storage_volume_snapshot" "foo" {
 name = "my-boot-volume/my-snapshot"
}

resource "opc_compute_storage_volume" "foo" {
 name = "from-snapshot"
 snapshot_id = "${opc_compute_storage_volume_snapshot.foo.snapshot_id}"
 size = "${opc_compute_storage_volume_snapshot.foo.snapshot_id}"
}
```
